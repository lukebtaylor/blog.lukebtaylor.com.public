There is a problem with this setup though.
Both NextCloud sync and Keepass will be trying to sync different verions of the database at some point.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have two computers, both pointing to the Keepass database stored on a synced cloud storage provider.</description></item><item><title>Keepass Plugins</title><link>http://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-plugins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:25:11 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-plugins/</guid><description>Must have plug-ins for KeePass https://bitbucket.org/ligos/readablepassphrasegenerator/wiki/Home</description></item><item><title>Keepass Mobile MiniKeePass</title><link>http://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-mobile-minikeepass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:06:36 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-mobile-minikeepass/</guid><description>I use NextCloud as a cloud storage provider and KeePass for password storage. It&amp;rsquo;s very useful to have access to those passwords from your phone.
MiniKeePass works great for reading KeePass database&amp;rsquo;s, but there is no good way to sync changes from the phone back to the database.
I use this as a read-only solution on the phone/tablet. It works good for that, but it is a bit inconvenient not being able to create new entries and have them sync back.</description></item><item><title>Keepass Desktop Setup</title><link>http://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-desktop-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:06:36 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-desktop-setup/</guid><description>Use KeePass for password management.
