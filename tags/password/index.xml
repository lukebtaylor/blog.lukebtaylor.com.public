I love Bitwarden, you can&amp;rsquo;t beat the pricing, and it&amp;rsquo;s open source! I pay for the family subscription, and it&amp;rsquo;s been great!
This list is about things that are not apparent when using Bitwarden. You can think of them as limitations of the system if you like.
If you export your vault, it does not include the file attachments If you import from another password manager, it won&amp;rsquo;t import the file attachments If you have the family plan and want to use file attachments (a premium feature) you will have to share your logins with the organization e.</description></item><item><title>Keepass Syncing the Database</title><link>https://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-syncing-the-database/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:25:36 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-syncing-the-database/</guid><description>Storing the Keepass database in your NextCloud, Google Drive, OneDrive, or other storage is convenient if ou need to have access to the database from multiple machines both in and out of your home network.
There is a problem with this setup though.
Both NextCloud sync and Keepass will be trying to sync different verions of the database at some point.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have two computers, both pointing to the Keepass database stored on a synced cloud storage provider.</description></item><item><title>Keepass Plugins</title><link>https://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-plugins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:25:11 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-plugins/</guid><description>Must have plug-ins for KeePass https://bitbucket.org/ligos/readablepassphrasegenerator/wiki/Home</description></item><item><title>Keepass Mobile MiniKeePass</title><link>https://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-mobile-minikeepass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:06:36 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-mobile-minikeepass/</guid><description>I use NextCloud as a cloud storage provider and KeePass for password storage. It&amp;rsquo;s very useful to have access to those passwords from your phone.
MiniKeePass works great for reading KeePass database&amp;rsquo;s, but there is no good way to sync changes from the phone back to the database.
I use this as a read-only solution on the phone/tablet. It works good for that, but it is a bit inconvenient not being able to create new entries and have them sync back.</description></item><item><title>Keepass Desktop Setup</title><link>https://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-desktop-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2018 16:06:36 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lukebtaylor.com/posts/keepass-desktop-setup/</guid><description>Use KeePass for password management.
